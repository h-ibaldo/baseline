# Claude Code Guidelines for LineBasis

> **IMPORTANT**: Read this file at the start of EVERY Claude Code session before making any changes!

This document ensures Claude Code follows LineBasis project rules from `.cursorrules` consistently.

---

## 🎯 COMMIT POLICY (MANDATORY)

### **Phase Completion Commit Strategy**

**RULE**: Every phase completion MUST have a commit and push to preserve stable checkpoints.

**Best Practice - Feature Commits + Phase Milestone**:

```
During Phase (feat branch):
├── feat(auth): add JWT authentication          [commit 1]
├── feat(media): implement file upload          [commit 2]
├── feat(admin): create admin panel             [commit 3]
├── chore(setup): add database setup            [commit 4]
├── docs: update documentation                  [commit 5]

Phase Complete:
└── docs: phase 1.5 complete [MILESTONE]        [commit 6]
    - Merge feat branch to main
    - Push to remote
    - Tag release (optional): v0.1.5
```

**Why this approach?**
- ✅ Fine-grained history (can bisect bugs)
- ✅ Each feature independently trackable
- ✅ Clear phase milestones in git history
- ✅ Easy rollback to stable checkpoints
- ✅ Better collaboration (pull stable phases)

**Mandatory Actions at Phase Completion:**
1. ✅ All features committed with proper messages
2. ✅ Documentation updated (roadmap, README, architecture)
3. ✅ Final milestone commit: `docs: phase X complete [MILESTONE]`
4. ✅ Push to remote: `git push origin main`
5. ✅ Optional: Tag release `git tag v0.X.0 && git push --tags`

## 🔴 MANDATORY WORKFLOW FOR ROADMAP TASKS

### Before Starting ANY Roadmap Task:

```bash
# 1. Check current branch
git branch

# 2. Create feature branch (REQUIRED!)
git checkout -b feat/task-name

# Example branch names:
# feat/cms-authentication
# feat/media-upload
# feat/admin-panel
# feat/page-manager-ui
# fix/baseline-snap-bug
```

### During Implementation:

1. ✅ **Write code** with proper TypeScript types
2. ✅ **Add error handling** and validation
3. ✅ **Write/update tests** for new functionality
4. ✅ **Follow naming conventions**:
   - Files: `kebab-case.ts`
   - Components: `PascalCase.svelte`
   - Functions: `camelCase()`
   - Types: `PascalCase`
   - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`

### After Implementation (BEFORE MERGING):

1. ✅ **Run tests**: `npm run test:run` - ALL must pass
2. ✅ **Update roadmap**: Mark tasks complete in `docs/planning/roadmap.md`
3. ✅ **Update README**: Add new features to `README.md`
4. ✅ **Update architecture**: If needed, update `docs/planning/architecture.md`
5. ✅ **Create proper commits** (see format below)
6. ✅ **Merge to main**: `git checkout main && git merge feat/task-name`
7. ✅ **Push to main**: `git push origin main`
8. ✅ **Delete branch**: `git branch -d feat/task-name`

## 🎯 Code Quality Checklist

Before committing, verify:

- [ ] ✅ All TypeScript files have proper types (no `any`)
- [ ] ✅ Error handling in place (try-catch, validation)
- [ ] ✅ JSDoc comments on public functions
- [ ] ✅ Tests written and passing (`npm run test:run`)
- [ ] ✅ No console.log() in production code
- [ ] ✅ Proper HTTP status codes in API responses
- [ ] ✅ Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] ✅ Security best practices (password hashing, JWT, etc.)

---

## 🔐 Security Checklist

For auth/security features:

- [ ] ✅ Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10+ rounds)
- [ ] ✅ JWT tokens signed with secure secret
- [ ] ✅ Refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies
- [ ] ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] ✅ Rate limiting considered (future)
- [ ] ✅ SQL injection prevention (Prisma handles this)
- [ ] ✅ XSS prevention (framework handles this)

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Test Categories:

1. **Unit Tests**: For utilities, pure functions
2. **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints
3. **E2E Tests** (future): For user workflows

### When to Write Tests:

- ✅ **ALWAYS**: Utility functions (`baseline.ts`, `event-reducer.ts`)
- ✅ **RECOMMENDED**: Service functions (`auth.ts`, `upload.ts`)
- ⏳ **FUTURE**: API endpoint integration tests
- ⏳ **FUTURE**: E2E tests for user flows

### Test Commands:

```bash
npm run test        # Watch mode
npm run test:run    # Run once
npm run test:ui     # Visual UI
```

---

## 📁 File Organization Rules

### Naming & Location:

```
src/lib/server/
├── services/           # Business logic
│   ├── auth.ts         # Authentication service
│   ├── upload.ts       # File upload service
│   └── pages.ts        # Page service
├── middleware/         # Express-style middleware
│   └── auth.ts         # Auth middleware
└── db/
    └── client.ts       # Database client

src/routes/api/
├── auth/              # Auth endpoints
│   ├── login/+server.ts
│   └── register/+server.ts
├── media/             # Media endpoints
│   └── upload/+server.ts
└── pages/             # Page endpoints
    └── +server.ts
```

### Import Aliases:

```typescript
import { auth } from '$lib/server/services/auth';  // ✅ Good
import { auth } from '../../../lib/server/...';     // ❌ Bad
```

## 🎓 Learning from Mistakes

### Phase 1.5 Mistakes (Learn from these!):

1. ❌ **No feature branches created** → Should have had 3 separate branches
2. ❌ **Roadmap not updated** → Should mark tasks complete immediately
3. ❌ **No proper commit strategy** → Should commit after each feature
4. ✅ **Good code quality** → TypeScript, types, error handling all good!
5. ✅ **Good documentation** → Created comprehensive guides

**Lesson**: Process is as important as code quality!

---
