# LineBasis

**A self-hosted visual website builder with professional design tools and modern technology.**

Design websites visually with real web components. Own your code, your data, your platform. No monthly fees. 100% open source.

---

## The Problem

After shipping successful products like TidyCal, SendFox, and BreezeDoc at AppSumo Originals, I kept hitting the same wall when building websites:

**WordPress?** Free and self-hosted, but Gutenberg is a nightmare. You build React blocks that convert to PHP. It breaks constantly.

**Visual builders (Webflow, Framer)?** Beautiful editors, but you're paying $15-30/month per site to rent your own website. The code isn't really yours. You can't customize the platform.

**Figma + code it yourself?** Figma components aren't real web components. Divs aren't divs. The design-to-code handoff adds unnecessary abstraction layers.

And here's what really bugs me: graphic designers figured out typography and layout 100 years ago. Baseline grids, vertical rhythm, proper alignment‚Äîthese aren't new problems. But most web design tools ignore them.

## The Solution

LineBasis is the tool I wish existed:

‚úÖ **Visual website builder** with polished, modern UX
‚úÖ **Self-hosted and 100% open source** - Install once, use forever
‚úÖ **Design with real web elements** - Divs are divs, components are components
‚úÖ **Own everything** - Your code, your data, your platform
‚úÖ **No monthly fees** - Pay once for hosting, that's it
‚úÖ **Modern tech stack** - SvelteKit, TypeScript, Prisma
‚úÖ **Baseline grid support** - Because typography matters

Build sites for friends, side projects, product landing pages‚Äîwhatever you need. Customize it if you want. It's your platform.

## Current Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è Replanning Phase Complete - Implementation Starting**

LineBasis is being rebuilt from the ground up with a clear, well-documented architecture.

### ‚úÖ Planning Complete (October 2024)

Complete technical specifications written (5,637 lines of documentation):

- **[app.md](docs/planning/app.md)** - Application structure, routing, UI specifications
- **[page-builder-spec.md](docs/planning/page-builder-spec.md)** - Designer interface specification
- **[architecture.md](docs/planning/architecture.md)** - Technical architecture, database schema, event sourcing
- **[workflows.md](docs/planning/workflows.md)** - User workflows and journeys
- **[component-properties.md](docs/planning/components-properties.md)** - Component property specifications

### üöß Next Steps (Implementation)

1. Database schema setup (Prisma models)
2. Authentication system (JWT + RBAC)
3. Page builder UI (Svelte components)
4. Event sourcing system (IndexedDB + undo/redo)
5. Code generation pipeline (events ‚Üí Svelte components)
6. Publishing system (SSR rendering)

**Not accepting external contributions yet.** Will open contributions once the core foundation is stable.

## Project Philosophy

This is a solo project by Ibaldo, built with deep focus on complex problems. I'm autistic, so I work best solo with sustained concentration. That's how Linux started. That's how Laravel started. And that's how I'm building this‚Äîone focused sprint at a time.

The goal isn't just to build another website builder. It's to create a tool that respects designers' expertise (baseline grids, typography), respects developers' needs (real code, modern stack), and respects users' freedom (self-hosted, open source, no lock-in).

It's ambitious. It's early. But after shipping multiple successful products, I know what it takes to build something people actually use.
