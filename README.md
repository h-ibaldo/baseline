# LineBasis

An open source project with huge ambition and expectations. The goal of this project is to fill a gap in the market of webdesign ecosystems replacing Wordpress, Figma (for web) and tools like Webflow. The success metric is to power 20% of the web in 5 years.

**Official Website:** [linebasis.org](https://linebasis.org) (linebasis.com redirects here)

## The problems we're trying to solve:

1. **WordPress** allows full customization and you own the code. It's not platform dependent. But offers a poor and extremely outdated DX and UX and technology.

2. **Figma** is private sector. It's the best design experience (but still can be highly improved). Dynamic UX. However, you don't design directly with web components. A div is not a div. As a result, only complicated and stressful layers of abstraction are offered to bridge the gap between design and code.

3. **Webflow and similar tools** are private sector. They allow you to design with the actual code of your website. But you have to pay high fees. You cannot change much of the tool itself. 

## How we solve this:

**Dual-Mode Architecture**: Baseline works in two ways:

1. **Designer Mode** (Browser-based, Local-First)
   - Design and build pages entirely in your browser
   - No installation or server required
   - Export clean code (HTML/CSS/Svelte)
   - Perfect for prototyping, learning, or designing for clients
   - Try it free at baseline.app

2. **CMS Mode** (Self-Hosted, Full-Stack)
   - Install on your own server (VPS, shared hosting, Docker)
   - Design AND publish pages directly to your domain
   - Full content management system
   - Multi-user support with role-based permissions
   - Media library, SEO tools, blog system
   - True WordPress replacement with modern technology

**Design Experience**: Clean, light, dynamic (multiple artboards), you design with the actual code of your actual page. Designer focused. Allows you to design a visual identity for the website with variables and components, templates and themes. Allows you to design based on a line basis grid. Aligns text to baseline grid like InDesign, appealing to demanding Graphic Designers. Built in animation system in the future.

**You own everything**: The code, the data, and the platform. Developers or curious designers can change anything. Extensible via plugin system, themes, and component libraries.

**100% free and open-source.** Currently in early development - not accepting external contributions yet. Will open contributions once the core foundation is established.
