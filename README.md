# Baseline

An open source project with huge ambition and expectations. The goal of this project is to fill a gap in the market of webdesign ecosystems replacing Wordpress, Figma (for web) and tools like Webflow. The success metric is to power 20% of the web in 5 years.

## The problems we're trying to solve:

1. **WordPress** allows full customization and you own the code. It's not platform dependent. But offers a poor and extremely outdated DX and UX and technology.

2. **Figma** is private sector. It's the best design experience (but still can be highly improved). Dynamic UX. However, you don't design directly with web components. A div is not a div. As a result, only complicated and stressful layers of abstraction are offered to bridge the gap between design and code.

3. **Webflow and similar tools** are private sector. They allow you to design with the actual code of your website. But you have to pay high fees. You cannot change much of the tool itself. 

## How we solve this:

**Dual-Mode Architecture**: Baseline works in two ways:

1. **Designer Mode** (Browser-based, Local-First)
   - Design and build pages entirely in your browser
   - No installation or server required
   - Export clean code (HTML/CSS/Svelte)
   - Perfect for prototyping, learning, or designing for clients
   - Try it free at baseline.app

2. **CMS Mode** (Self-Hosted, Full-Stack)
   - Install on your own server (VPS, shared hosting, Docker)
   - Design AND publish pages directly to your domain
   - Full content management system
   - Multi-user support with role-based permissions
   - Media library, SEO tools, blog system
   - True WordPress replacement with modern technology

**Design Experience**: Clean, light, dynamic (multiple artboards), you design with the actual code of your actual page. Designer focused. Allows you to design a visual identity for the website with variables and components, templates and themes. Allows you to design based on a baseline. Aligns text to baseline like InDesign, appealing to demanding Graphic Designers. Built in animation system in the future.

**You own everything**: The code, the data, and the platform. Developers or curious designers can change anything. Extensible via plugin system, themes, and component libraries.

**100% free and open-source.** Currently in early development - not accepting external contributions yet. Will open contributions once the core foundation is established.

## Development

This project is built with SvelteKit and TypeScript.

### Getting Started

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Project Structure

- `src/routes/` - Application pages and routes
- `src/lib/` - Reusable components and utilities
- `static/` - Static assets
- `docs/` - Project documentation and planning

### Current Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è Early Development Phase**

Baseline is currently in early development and is **NOT accepting external contributions** at this time.

**‚úÖ Phase 1 - Designer Tool (Completed):**
- ‚úÖ **DOM-based Canvas** - Infinite canvas with multiple artboards, drag-and-drop, selection, resize handles, multi-select
- ‚úÖ **Baseline Grid System** - InDesign-style baseline alignment with snap-to-grid, visual overlay, per-component overrides
- ‚úÖ **Event Sourcing** - Perfect undo/redo with complete event history and time-travel debugging
- ‚úÖ **IndexedDB Persistence** - Local-first architecture with auto-save, project management, and offline support
- ‚úÖ **Component Library** - 9 baseline-aware design components (Typography, Layout, Forms)
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework** - Vitest setup with 40+ comprehensive tests

**üöß Phase 1.5 - Code Generation (In Progress):**
- AST-based code generation
- HTML/CSS export
- Svelte component export
- Code preview panel

**üìã Phase 2 - CMS Mode (Planned):**
- Database integration (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
- Publishing system (design ‚Üí live pages)
- Admin panel with page manager
- Media library
- User authentication & roles
- Multi-page website management
- SEO tools

Contributions will open once we have a stable foundation. Watch the repository for updates!
