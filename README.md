# LineBasis

**A self-hosted visual website builder with professional design tools and modern technology.**

Design websites visually with real web components. Own your code, your data, your platform. No monthly fees. 100% open source.

## The Problem

After shipping successful products like TidyCal, SendFox, and BreezeDoc at AppSumo Originals, I kept hitting the same wall when building websites:

**WordPress?** Free and self-hosted, but Gutenberg is a nightmare. You build React blocks that convert to PHP. It breaks constantly.

**Visual builders (Webflow, Framer)?** Beautiful editors, but you're paying $15-30/month per site to rent your own website. The code isn't really yours. You can't customize the platform.

**Figma + code it yourself?** Figma components aren't real web components. Divs aren't divs. The design-to-code handoff adds unnecessary abstraction layers.

And here's what really bugs me: graphic designers figured out typography and layout 100 years ago. Baseline grids, vertical rhythm, proper alignment—these aren't new problems. But most web design tools ignore them.

## The Solution

LineBasis is the tool I wish existed:

✅ **Visual website builder** with polished, modern UX
✅ **Self-hosted and 100% open source** - Install once, use forever
✅ **Design with real web elements** - Divs are divs, components are components
✅ **Own everything** - Your code, your data, your platform
✅ **No monthly fees** - Pay once for hosting, that's it
✅ **Modern tech stack** - SvelteKit, TypeScript, Prisma
✅ **Baseline grid support** - Because typography matters

Build sites for friends, side projects, product landing pages—whatever you need. Customize it if you want. It's your platform.

## Key Features

### 🎨 Professional Page Builder
- **Illustrator-style interface**: Floating windows, infinite canvas, keyboard shortcuts
- **3 atomic components**: Div (layout), Text (typography), Media (images/videos)
- **Frames**: Multi-artboard canvas like Figma - design desktop, tablet, mobile in one view
- **Baseline grid**: InDesign-style typography alignment with snap-to-grid
- **Event sourcing**: Perfect undo/redo with complete design history
- **Local-first**: Design in browser with IndexedDB, auto-save every 30 seconds

### 🧩 Reusable Blocks
- **Convert designs to blocks**: Select elements → right-click → "Convert to Block"
- **Master-instance system**: Edit master block → updates all instances across all pages
- **Auto-detachment**: Edit an instance → automatically detaches for one-off customization
- **Push to master**: Like your changes? Push them back to the master block
- **Organized by source page**: Blocks grouped by the page where they were created

### 📐 Design System (Tokens)
- **Global tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing, effects
- **Typography presets**: Heading 1-6, Body, Caption, Small
- **Theme colors**: Primary, Secondary, Accent, Text, Muted
- **Baseline grid**: Configure grid unit (4-32px), snap elements to rhythm
- **One-click updates**: Change token → all components using it update

### 📝 Blog System (Plugin)
- **Design blog templates**: Create layouts in page builder for homepage, single post, archives
- **Notion-like editor**: Rich text with slash commands, inline formatting, media embeds
- **PostContent block**: Special block that renders blog post content in templates
- **Categories & Tags**: Organize posts with flexible taxonomy
- **SEO-ready**: Meta tags, social preview images, automatic sitemaps

### 🚀 Publishing & Export
- **Server-side rendering**: Published pages render as Svelte components with SSR
- **Responsive CSS**: Design breakpoints → generates mobile-first media queries
- **Static export**: Download pages as pure HTML/CSS .zip for hosting anywhere
- **Theme sharing**: Export/import entire sites (.baseline-theme files or API transfer)

### 👥 Multi-User & Permissions
- **Role-based access**: Owner, Manager, Designer, Editor
- **Team collaboration**: Invite members, assign roles, manage access
- **JWT authentication**: Secure login with refresh tokens
- **Per-resource permissions**: Fine-grained control over who can edit/publish/delete

### 🔌 Plugin Architecture
- **Extensible core**: Add features without touching core code
- **Database integration**: Plugins add Prisma models via schema composition
- **API routes**: Plugins register custom endpoints
- **Admin UI**: Plugins add pages to admin panel
- **Lifecycle hooks**: React to events (page publish, user create, etc.)

## Current Status

**⚠️ Replanning Phase Complete - Implementation Starting**

LineBasis is being rebuilt from the ground up with a clear, well-documented architecture.

### ✅ Planning Complete (October 2024)

Complete technical specifications written (5,637 lines of documentation):

- **[app.md](docs/planning/app.md)** - Application structure, routing, UI specifications
- **[page-builder-spec.md](docs/planning/page-builder-spec.md)** - Designer interface specification
- **[architecture.md](docs/planning/architecture.md)** - Technical architecture, database schema, event sourcing
- **[workflows.md](docs/planning/workflows.md)** - User workflows and journeys
- **[component-properties.md](docs/planning/components-properties.md)** - Component property specifications

### 🚧 Next Steps (Implementation)

1. Database schema setup (Prisma models)
2. Authentication system (JWT + RBAC)
3. Page builder UI (Svelte components)
4. Event sourcing system (IndexedDB + undo/redo)
5. Code generation pipeline (events → Svelte components)
6. Publishing system (SSR rendering)

**Not accepting external contributions yet.** Will open contributions once the core foundation is stable.

## Architecture Highlights

### Local-First Design
- Designer works entirely client-side (IndexedDB)
- Zero server latency during design
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Publish when ready → sends events to server

### Event Sourcing
- Every design action is an event
- Append-only event log
- Perfect undo/redo (time travel through history)
- Events replay to build current state

### Code Generation
- Design events → Component tree → AST → Svelte code
- Clean, semantic HTML output
- Mobile-first CSS with media queries
- SEO-friendly structure

### Plugin System
- Prisma schema composition (plugins add models)
- Dynamic route registration
- Lifecycle hooks
- Admin UI extensions

## Project Philosophy

This is a solo project by Ibaldo, built with deep focus on complex problems. I'm autistic, so I work best solo with sustained concentration. That's how Linux started. That's how Laravel started. And that's how I'm building this—one focused sprint at a time.

The goal isn't just to build another website builder. It's to create a tool that respects designers' expertise (baseline grids, typography), respects developers' needs (real code, modern stack), and respects users' freedom (self-hosted, open source, no lock-in).

It's ambitious. It's early. But after shipping multiple successful products, I know what it takes to build something people actually use.
