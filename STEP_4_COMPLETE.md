## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Removed Duplicate Blog Code from Core

All blog-related code has been successfully removed from the core codebase, as it now exists exclusively in the `plugins/blog/` directory.

#### Files Deleted:
- **Services** (3 files, ~440 lines):
  - `src/lib/server/services/posts.ts`
  - `src/lib/server/services/categories.ts`
  - `src/lib/server/services/tags.ts`

- **API Routes** (6 files, ~530 lines):
  - `src/routes/api/posts/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/posts/[id]/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/posts/[id]/publish/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/posts/[id]/unpublish/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/categories/+server.ts`
  - `src/routes/api/tags/+server.ts`

- **Admin UI** (1 file, ~560 lines):
  - `src/routes/admin/posts/+page.svelte`

#### Schema Changes:
- Removed blog models from `prisma/schema.prisma`:
  - `Post` model (35 lines)
  - `Category` model (25 lines)
  - `Tag` model (12 lines)
  - `PostCategory` junction model (10 lines)
  - `PostTag` junction model (10 lines)
- Removed `posts` relation from `User` model
- Created migration: `20251010014810_remove_blog_from_core`

#### Navigation Update:
- Removed "Posts" link from admin navigation in `src/routes/admin/+page.svelte`
- Admin now shows only core features: Dashboard, Pages, Media, Users, Plugins, Settings, Designer

### 2. Total Lines Removed
**1,747 lines** of duplicate code removed from core

---

## Current Core Architecture

After cleanup, LineBasis core now contains only essential features:

### Core Features
1. **Designer Tool** - Visual page builder
2. **Authentication** - JWT-based auth system
3. **Pages** - CMS foundation (event-sourced design)
4. **Media Library** - File upload and management
5. **User Management** - Admin, editor, author roles
6. **Settings** - Global configuration
7. **Plugin System** - Architecture for extensibility

### Database Schema (Core Only)
```prisma
- Page
- PageRevision
- Media
- User
- Session
- Setting
- Plugin
```

**Blog models now live exclusively in** `plugins/blog/prisma/schema.prisma`

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ **Dev server** runs without errors on http://localhost:5175/
2. ✅ **Plugin system** initializes: "✅ Registered plugin: Blog System (@linebasis/blog)"
3. ✅ **Plugin API** returns blog plugin details via `/api/plugins`
4. ✅ **Admin UI** loads successfully at `/admin/plugins`
5. ✅ **Database migration** applied successfully

## What's Next: Remaining Steps (5-8)

### Step 5: Dynamic Plugin Loading (~2 hours)
**Goal**: Make plugins fully dynamic at runtime

**Tasks**:
- Enhance `hooks.server.ts` to sync database state with registry
- Activate plugins marked as active in database
- Route plugin API requests dynamically
- Handle plugin errors gracefully
- Test activation/deactivation flow

**Current State**: Basic loading works, but activation is not yet functional

### Step 6: Schema Composition (~2 hours)
**Goal**: Merge core + active plugin schemas automatically

**Tasks**:
- Create `scripts/build-schema.ts`
- Auto-generate combined Prisma schema from core + active plugins
- Run migrations automatically when plugins activate/deactivate
- Handle schema conflicts
- Update `package.json` scripts

**Blocker**: Currently blog schema is separate - need composition for it to work

### Step 7: Testing & Documentation (~1-2 hours)
**Goal**: Document and test the plugin system

**Tasks**:
- Create `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md` guide
- Build example plugin starter template
- Test full plugin lifecycle (install → activate → use → deactivate → uninstall)
- Verify blog plugin works end-to-end
- Update main README

### Step 8: Migration Script (~1 hour)
**Goal**: Handle existing installations gracefully

**Tasks**:
- Auto-detect blog tables in existing databases
- Auto-install and activate blog plugin for existing users
- Preserve all existing blog data
- Update configuration files

**Note**: Important for backwards compatibility

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] Blog code completely removed from core
- [x] Core contains only essential features
- [x] Zero duplicate code between core and plugin
- [x] Database migration successful
- [x] Admin navigation updated
- [x] Dev server runs without errors
- [x] Plugin system loads blog plugin successfully
- [x] All commits follow best practices

---

## Next Immediate Action

**Recommended**: Continue with **Step 5: Dynamic Plugin Loading**

This step will make the plugin system fully functional by:
1. Syncing database state with registry on startup
2. Auto-activating plugins marked as active
3. Enabling the activate/deactivate buttons in admin UI
4. Routing plugin requests dynamically

**Estimated time**: 2 hours

**Alternative**: Take a break and resume later, as we've hit a significant milestone (50% complete).
