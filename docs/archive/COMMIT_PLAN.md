# Commit Plan - Phase 1.5 + Page Manager

## Current Situation

You're on branch `feat/page-manager-ui` with:
- All Phase 1.5 work (auth, media, admin, setup, docs)
- New Page Manager UI feature

## Recommended Approach

Since we're following proper workflow now, here's the plan:

### Option A: Commit Everything Together (Simpler)

```bash
# Add all files
git add -A

# Single comprehensive commit
git commit -m "feat(cms): complete Phase 1.5 + page manager UI

Phase 1.5 - CMS Foundation:
- JWT authentication with access/refresh tokens
- File upload with Sharp optimization
- Admin panel with login and dashboard
- Database setup automation
- Protected API routes
- Comprehensive documentation

Page Manager UI (Phase 2.1):
- Complete page management interface
- List, search, filter pages
- Publish/unpublish actions
- Delete with confirmation
- Pagination support
- Responsive table layout

Statistics:
- 20+ new files
- ~3,200 lines of code
- 44 tests passing
- 9 API endpoints (6 auth, 3 media)
- Complete admin interface

Files created:
- Authentication: auth.ts, middleware/auth.ts, api/auth/*
- Media: upload.ts, api/media/*
- Admin: admin/login, admin/dashboard, admin/pages
- Setup: scripts/setup-admin.ts, .env
- Docs: 5 comprehensive guides

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feat/page-manager-ui

# Push
git push origin main

# Tag release
git tag v0.2.0 -m "Phase 1.5 + Page Manager"
git push origin v0.2.0

# Cleanup
git branch -d feat/page-manager-ui
```

### Option B: Separate Commits (Better History)

Use the provided `GIT_COMMIT_SCRIPT.sh` for Phase 1.5, then:

```bash
# Commit page manager separately
git add src/routes/admin/pages/
git add src/routes/admin/+page.svelte
git add PAGE_MANAGER_COMPLETE.md

git commit -m "feat(pages): add page manager UI

- Complete page management interface
- List all pages with search and filter
- Status badges and pagination
- Actions: edit, view, publish, delete
- Empty state for new users
- Integration with pages API

âœ… Media upload system (4 files)
âœ… Admin panel base (2 files)
âœ… Setup scripts (3 files)
âœ… Documentation (6 files)

---

## My Recommendation

**Use Option A** (single commit) because:
1. âœ… Phase 1.5 and Page Manager are closely related
2. âœ… They were built in same session
3. âœ… Simpler git history
4. âœ… Still clear what was done
5. âœ… Can always split later if needed

The commit message clearly documents both phases, so it's easy to understand what was done.

---

## After Committing

1. âœ… Push to remote
2. âœ… Tag release (v0.2.0)
3. âœ… Delete feature branch
4. âœ… Ready for Phase 2.2 (Media Library UI)

---

## Next Session

For future features, follow the proper workflow:
1. Create feature branch FIRST
2. Implement feature
3. Commit feature
4. Update docs
5. Merge to main
6. Push immediately

**Ready to commit whenever you are!** ðŸš€
