## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Port Already in Use
If you see "Port 5173 is in use", the server will automatically try the next port (5174, 5175, etc.).

Check the terminal output to see which port is actually being used.

### Issue: Database Errors
If you encounter database errors:

```bash
# Regenerate database
npm run db:compose
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:generate

# Or run full setup
npm run setup
```

### Issue: Schema Composition Errors
If you see duplicate model errors:

```bash
# Check what would be composed (dry-run)
npm run db:compose:check

# Restore core schema
cp prisma/schema.core.prisma prisma/schema.prisma

# Recompose
npm run db:compose
```

### Issue: Login Not Working
Reset admin user:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will recreate the admin user with default credentials.

### Issue: Media Upload Fails
Check upload directory exists and is writable:

```bash
mkdir -p static/uploads
chmod 755 static/uploads
```

---

## 📊 Database Inspection

### View Database in Prisma Studio
```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Opens Prisma Studio at http://localhost:5555 where you can:
- View all tables
- Browse records
- Edit data directly
- Run queries
- View relationships
