# LineBasis Development Roadmap

## Current Priority: Page Builder

**Architecture Shift**: Everything is built with the page builder (admin pages, blog pages, landing pages) except the page builder itself, which is designed by Ibaldo.

**Focus**: Build the page builder based on Ibaldo's designs before anything else.
