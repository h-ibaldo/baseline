# AI Contribution Guidelines

## Overview

Baseline is a **highly vibe-coded project** that embraces AI contributions while maintaining human authorship and accountability. This document provides specific guidelines for AI-assisted development, human-AI collaboration, and hybrid contribution workflows.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human Authorship Required
- **All commits must be authored by humans**
- AI tools can generate code, but humans must review and commit
- Human developers maintain accountability for all changes
- AI assistance should be documented in commit messages

### 2. AI-Friendly Development
- **AI contributions are welcome and encouraged**
- Use AI tools for code generation, documentation, and problem-solving
- Embrace AI efficiency while maintaining human creativity
- Document AI tool usage transparently

### 3. Collaborative Workflow
- **Hybrid human-AI collaboration is preferred**
- AI generates initial code, humans refine and optimize
- Iterative improvement through AI-human feedback loops
- Combine AI speed with human expertise

## AI Contribution Workflows

### Workflow 1: AI Code Generation
```
1. Human identifies need for new feature/component
2. AI generates initial code (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot)
3. Human reviews and tests AI-generated code
4. Human refines and optimizes as needed
5. Human commits with AI assistance documented
```

**Example Commit:**
```
ai(components): generate responsive grid system with ChatGPT assistance

- AI generated base grid component
- Human reviewed and optimized for performance
- Added TypeScript types and error handling
- Tested across multiple screen sizes
```

### Workflow 2: AI-Human Iterative Development
```
1. Human provides requirements and context
2. AI generates initial implementation
3. Human reviews and provides feedback
4. AI refines based on human feedback
5. Human finalizes and commits
```

**Example Commit:**
```
feat(api): implement user authentication endpoints

AI-generated base implementation with Claude, human-optimized:
- Added proper error handling and validation
- Implemented rate limiting and security measures
- Added comprehensive test coverage
- Optimized database queries and response times
```

### Workflow 3: AI Documentation and Testing
```
1. Human writes core functionality
2. AI generates documentation and tests
3. Human reviews and refines AI output
4. Human commits with AI assistance noted
```

**Example Commit:**
```
docs(api): add comprehensive API documentation with AI assistance

- AI generated initial documentation structure
- Human reviewed and added project-specific details
- AI generated example code snippets
- Human validated and refined examples
```

  constructor(public text: string, public variant: string) {}
  
  render() {
    return `<button class="btn btn-${this.variant}">${this.text}</button>`;
  }
}

// Human-optimized version
export interface ButtonProps {
  text: string;
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline';
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export class Button {
  constructor(private props: ButtonProps) {}
  
  render(): string {
    const { text, variant, disabled, onClick } = this.props;
    const classes = `btn btn-${variant} ${disabled ? 'disabled' : ''}`;
    
    return `<button class="${classes}" ${disabled ? 'disabled' : ''} ${onClick ? `onclick="${onClick}"` : ''}>${text}</button>`;
  }
}
```

### Example 2: API Development
```typescript
// AI-generated API endpoint
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  const users = getUsers();
  res.json(users);
});

// Human-optimized version
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { page = 1, limit = 10, search } = req.query;
    const users = await userService.getUsers({
      page: Number(page),
      limit: Number(limit),
      search: search as string
    });
    
    res.json({
      users,
      pagination: {
        page: Number(page),
        limit: Number(limit),
        total: users.length
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
