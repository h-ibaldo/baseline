Linebasis is an ambitious project with a clear mission: to create the next free and open-source technology that will power half of the internet.

The problem
WordPress is free and open source, but it is built on outdated technology and delivers poor design, development, and user experiences.

Tools like Webflow and Framer provide polished, modern interfaces, but at the cost of freedom. You rent your own website, and the pricing is confusing and expensive.

Meanwhile, we design websites in tools that are not truly web tools. In apps like Figma or Sketch, a div is not a div. Turning design into code demands layers of abstraction. At this point, learning to code is simpler than learning the workarounds.

On top of that, graphic designers solved core layout and typography problems a century ago, yet the web still ignores them. CSS only recently exposed baseline alignment, and almost nobody implements it.

The solution

Linebasis is a platform that is 100% free and open source, built with advanced, ergonomic, and modern web technologies. It combines the best of visual design with real native web elements.

Itâ€™s something you can own, change, improve, collaborate on, and grow from.

And yes: it has a baseline grid.
