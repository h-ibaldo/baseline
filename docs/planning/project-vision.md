# Why LineBasis Exists

I've shipped frontend and UX for TidyCal, SendFox, BreezeDoc, and other products at AppSumo Originals. I've built websites for friends, for side projects, for things I care about.

Every time, I face the same frustrating choice:
Use WordPress? Free and self-hosted, but the developer experience is a nightmare. Gutenberg makes developers cry — you build React blocks that convert to PHP, it's a mess, and it breaks constantly.

Use visual website builders? Beautiful editors, but I'm paying $15-30 per site per month to rent my own websites. The code isn't really mine. I can't customize the platform.


Use Figma and code it myself? Figma components aren't real components. Divs aren't divs. The handoff process adds layers of abstraction that shouldn't exist.

And here's the thing that really bugs me: graphic designers figured out typography and layout 100 years ago. Baseline grids, vertical rhythm, proper alignment — these aren't new problems. But web design tools mostly ignore them.

# What I'm Building
LineBasis is the tool I wish existed:
* Visual website builder with polished, modern UX
* Self-hosted and 100% open source
* Design with real web elements (divs are divs, components are components)
* Own your code, your data, your platform
* No monthly fees per site
* Modern tech stack (SvelteKit, TypeScript)
* Proper baseline grid support (because typography matters)

Build sites for friends, side projects, product landing pages—whatever you need. Install it once, use it forever. Customize it if you want.

It's ambitious. It's early. But after shipping multiple successful products, I know what it takes to build something people actually use.

I'm autistic, so I work best solo with deep focus on complex problems. That's how Linux started. That's how Laravel started. And that's how I'm building this—one focused sprint at a time.
