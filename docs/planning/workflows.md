## Creating Reusable Blocks

**Goal**: Convert a designed element into a reusable block that can be used across multiple pages.

**User**: Designer or above

### Scenario
You've designed a "Call-to-Action" section (Div with heading, text, and button) and want to reuse it on multiple pages.

### Steps

1. **Design the Element**
   - In designer, create your CTA section:
     - Div container (background: blue, padding: 60px)
       - Text: Heading "Ready to Get Started?"
       - Text: Body "Join thousands of happy users today."
       - Div: Button-styled (background: white, padding: 16px 32px)
         - Text: "Sign Up Now"

2. **Select Elements**
   - Click and drag to select all elements
   - OR Click parent Div → selects entire CTA section
   - Selection handles appear around all selected elements

3. **Convert to Block**
   - Right-click on selection
   - Select "Convert to Block" from context menu

   **Modal Opens**:
   - **Block Name**: "CTA Section"
   - **Preview**: Shows thumbnail of selected design
   - Click "Create Block" button

4. **System Creates Block**
   - Block saved to database
   - Block appears in Blocks window
   - Organized under current page folder (e.g., "Homepage" folder)
   - Original elements replaced with block instance
   - Block instance looks identical but marked as instance

5. **View in Blocks Window**
   - Open Blocks window (`Cmd+Shift+B`)
   - Expand "Homepage" folder
   - See "CTA Section" block:
     - Thumbnail preview
     - Name: "CTA Section"
     - Used in: 1 page

6. **Use Block on Another Page**
   - Open different page in designer
   - Open Blocks window
   - Find "CTA Section" under "Homepage" folder
   - **Method 1**: Drag block onto canvas
   - **Method 2**: Click block → Click "Insert to Canvas"

   Block instance appears on new page

7. **Verify Instance Link**
   - Both instances (original page + new page) linked to master
   - Edit master → both update
   - Instances shown in Blocks window: "Used in: 2 pages"

**Result**: Reusable block created and can be inserted on any page. Changes to master block propagate to all instances.

**Folder Organization**: Blocks organized by source page. If you create a block on "Homepage", it appears in "Homepage" folder in Blocks window.

---

## Editing Master Blocks

**Goal**: Update a master block so changes propagate to all instances across all pages.

**User**: Designer or above

### Scenario
You have a "CTA Section" block used on 5 pages. You want to change the button color from white to yellow.

### Steps

1. **Locate Block**
   - Navigate to `/admin/blocks`
   - OR Open Blocks window in designer (`Cmd+Shift+B`)
   - Find "CTA Section" block
   - Shows "Used in: 5 pages"

2. **Edit Master Block**
   - Right-click on "CTA Section"
   - Select "Edit Block"

   **System Behavior**:
   - Opens the original page where block was created
   - Designer loads: `/admin/designer/{source-page-id}`
   - Block instance on source page automatically highlighted
   - Selection handles appear around block

3. **Modify Block**
   - Select button Div within block
   - In Properties window:
     - Background: Change from white (#ffffff) to yellow (#ffeb3b)
   - Change reflects immediately in canvas

4. **Save Changes** (Auto)
   - Changes auto-save to IndexedDB
   - After 30 seconds, changes persist

5. **Publish Page** (Optional)
   - If source page is published, click "Publish" to update live version
   - If source page is just a "blocks library" page, no need to publish

6. **Changes Propagate**
   - All 5 instances across all pages now have yellow button
   - Next time those pages publish, they include updated block

7. **Verify Changes**
   - Navigate to one of the pages using the block
   - Open in designer
   - Confirm button is now yellow

**Result**: Master block updated, all instances reflect changes.

**Important**: Editing the master block updates the block definition. Pages using the block must be re-published for live sites to show changes.

---

## Detaching and Resyncing Blocks

**Scenario**: You have a block instance but want to customize it for one specific page without affecting other instances.

### Detaching a Block Instance

1. **Direct Edit on Instance**
   - Open page with block instance in designer
   - Click on block instance (shows as single unit)
   - Edit any property (e.g., change button text)

   **System Behavior**:
   - Block automatically detaches
   - Badge appears: "Detached"
   - Override events stored separately
   - Other instances unaffected

2. **Detached Block Behavior**
   - This instance no longer updates from master
   - Independent from other instances
   - Can make any changes

3. **Push Changes to Master** (Optional)
   - Right-click detached instance
   - Select "Push to Master"
   - Confirmation dialog: "This will update all other instances. Continue?"
   - Click "Confirm"

   **Result**: Master block updates with your changes, all non-detached instances update

4. **Reset to Master**
   - Right-click detached instance
   - Select "Reset to Master"
   - Confirmation dialog: "This will discard your changes. Continue?"
   - Click "Confirm"

   **Result**: Instance reverts to master block design, no longer detached

**Use Cases**:
- **Detach**: One-off customization for specific page
- **Push to Master**: Your customization should be the new default
- **Reset to Master**: Undo your customization, return to standard
